# Cyber Scripts - C!ph3r 1337

Welcome to my collection of cyber scripts! This repository contains a variety of scripts for automation, cybersecurity tasks, and general-purpose operations. The scripts are written in different languages—including Python and Bash—to cover a wide range of needs. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced professional, feel free to explore, modify, and contribute.

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before running any scripts, ensure you have the necessary environments and dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x** (Recommended: latest version)
- **Bash** (or a compatible shell)
- Other language runtimes as needed (check the specific script requirements)

To verify if Python is installed, run:
```bash
python3 --version
```

For Bash, simply open a terminal.

## 🚀 Running a Script

### Python Scripts
Navigate to the appropriate directory and run:
```bash
python3 script_name.py
```
Some Python scripts may require additional arguments. Check the usage with:
```bash
python3 script_name.py --help
```

### Bash Scripts
Ensure the script has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```
Then execute it:
```bash
./script_name.sh
```

### Other Scripts
For scripts written in other languages, please refer to their specific documentation for instructions on how to run them.

## ⚙️ Installing Dependencies

Many scripts require additional libraries or modules. For Python scripts, install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For scripts in other languages, consult the corresponding package manager or documentation.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

These scripts are intended for educational and ethical use only. Always use them responsibly and ensure you have proper authorization before running any security-related scripts.
